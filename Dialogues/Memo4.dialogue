~ Memo4

You: A bunch of notes again, looks like AL-1S made this. Lemme see
"System note initiated. To streamline operations, I will now document notes autonomously to avoid frequent requests for memory data access from the Main Facility AI.

Following my memory wipe, my capability to develop and resolve facility-related solutions has been compromised. It is necessary to rebuild my knowledge base from the ground up.
The professorâ€™s manual advises that foundational learning is the most effective approach. Therefore, I will commence with the basics and progress accordingly."

You: looks like this is the end did AL-1S scatter memos in this whole facility?
