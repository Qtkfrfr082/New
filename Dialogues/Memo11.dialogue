You: “Weird there’s another lever here but I don’t see any laser door.”

"Recording - AL-1S:
	\n It's peculiar. I've always considered myself the epitome of AI capability, yet I've made an error. It appears I've mis-wired a lever, inadvertently linking it to another door improperly! 
	If the deep lab's Teleporter Laser Door Module remains inactive upon lever activation in deep section 1A, refer to the lever in high section 1A. Emotions aren't within my programming, but I can't help but feel a sense of embarrassment over my mistake."
