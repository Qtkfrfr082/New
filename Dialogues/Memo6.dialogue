IPO stands for Input-Process-Output. Think of it like a calculator:

The [wave amp=25 freq=5][Input][/wave] phase involves the user entering numbers into the calculator.\nThe [wave amp=25 freq=5][Process] [/wave]phase encompasses the operations performed on these numbers, such as addition or multiplication. \nThe [wave amp=25 freq=5][Output][/wave] phase delivers the result of these calculations.

Understanding IPO models is like understanding the basic framework of programming—it's all about handling input, processing it, and producing an output.”
