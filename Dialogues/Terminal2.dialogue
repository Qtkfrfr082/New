~ Terminal2

You: “Nice another Terminal.”
Terminal: "Record - AL-1S :\n 
I've acquired a grasp of fundamental programming principles and learned to adeptly evaluate problems, identifying key focal points. Upon assimilating these principles, I've integrated FlowCharts into my logical framework."

You: “She started using flowcharts now huh”

Terminal: "Continuation - AL-1S:\n
Following the facility's stabilization, I've discovered that I'm not the sole inhabitant. Experimental specimens, unattended due to staff shortages, have breached containment and are wandering the premises.

To mitigate potential risks, I've devised various perplexing mechanisms to restrict their movement within the facility. Additionally, I've distributed notes detailing procedures for dismantling these constraints should the need arise."
