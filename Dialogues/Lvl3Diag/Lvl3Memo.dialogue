'Recording\: AL-1S' \nThis place is crawling with critters I'll have to proceed with caution, I'm starting \nto get annoyed with the amount of evading I must do while cleaning up the place, seriously why would they not give me defensive capabilities if this place is dangerous.
So, I put a counter measure in place! I manually rigged the signage where the elevators go but I left hints to safely navigate this place! There're three pathways that lead to the control room, one is the truth and the other two is false! Try to solve the answer to get out of the place!
You: Typical.
And remember these elevators might lead you to uncertain doom. Be careful.

Programming 101\: Lets go back again with Iteration Statements! \nIn this example, the for loop runs five times, printing "Java is fun" each time. Loops are crucial because they enable repetitive tasks to be performed efficiently without redundant code.
Whether iterating through elements in a collection, performing repeated calculations, or handling multiple user inputs, loops streamline these processes and make code more readable and maintainable.

You: The computer sending some type of message?
Hello? Is there anyone here? A human presence detected. Hmm? I was notified of unusual activity in this sector. Could it be another bug nest? Sigh, I suppose I'll need to clean up that area once more.
You: Hello? is this AL-1S?
AHHH? Hello? Hello? Is there a human presence detected? But how? There shouldn't be humans in this sector. Ahhh, please excuse my surprise. It's been a long time since anyone responded to the intercoms. According to my records, it must have been centuries since the last. Anyway, please disregard my ramblings. It's been quite some time since I've used my voice modules.
You: Never mind that AL-1S I need help right now! Where are you right now? Can you help me?
Yes, my programming dictates that humans are my highest priority. I am on the floor directly below the Control Room. Just use the teleportation module, and you'll be here in a few moments!
