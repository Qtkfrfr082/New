1. [color=green]Java history and basic characteristics. (platform independence, object-oriented nature)[/color]

2. [color=green]Variable declaration and types in Java.[/color]

3. [color=green]Basic input and output operations in Java.[/color]

4. [color=green]Program flow control statements, including if-else and switch-case.[/color]

5. [color=green]Introduction to iteration structures. (loops)[/color]

Players will encounter various challenges that require them to apply these concepts, such as navigating through teleportation modules based on selection structures. They'll also find more detailed memos from AL-1S that explain Java-specific ideas and provide code snippets for better understanding. The level culminates in reaching a control room, setting up the next phase of the journey while reinforcing the learned programming concepts."
