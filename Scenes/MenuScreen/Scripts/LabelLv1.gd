They'll encounter various memos left behind by AL-1S, an android tasked with maintaining the facility. 

Through these memos, players will learn fundamental programming concepts such as:

1. [color=aqua]The Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model.[/color]

2. [color=aqua]Algorithms and their importance in problem-solving.[/color]

3. [color=aqua]Pseudocode as a tool for simplifying complex problems.[/color]

4. [color=aqua]Flowcharts and their various shapes for representing program flow.[/color]

5. [color=aqua]Basic concepts of Selection Control Structures.[/color]

Players will navigate through different areas, solving simple puzzles and gathering information that introduces them to these core programming ideas. 

The level sets the stage for more complex concepts to come while providing context through the facility's mysterious backstory."
